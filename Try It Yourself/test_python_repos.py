'''
17-3. Testing python_repos_visual.py: In python_repos_visual.py, we printed the value of
status_code to make sure the API call was successful. Write a program called
test_python_repos.py that uses unittest to assert that the value of status_code
is 200. Figure out some other assertions you can makeâ€”for example, that the
number of items returned is expected and that the total number of repositories
is greater than a certain amount.
